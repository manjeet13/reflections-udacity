When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-> I would use a remote repository when I want to share my project with a group of people or if I want to make it publicly available(open-source).


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

-> Because you first want to make sure that those changes are worth accommodating to your local repo.
Because if you're working on something new, say a new feature, you may want to accomodate all the changes up until this point before starting.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

-> Fork is github's built in feature to clone someone else's repo on your github to make changes the way you want.
   Cloning is the process of copying the whole repo from github onto your local machine.
   Branching is the process of creating a separate patch in order to make experimental changes to a project. It can be done either on local repo, github or both.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

->So that you know the starting point of 2 branches, i.e., you know what is the last common commit in the 2 repos.
